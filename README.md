# Absenteeism Data Cleaning Project
## Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a dataset related to employee absenteeism. The objective is to refine raw data into meaningful quantitative information by addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and structural disorganization.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Understanding the Dataset 
- Examined the dataset to identify key variables
- Focused on `Absenteeism Time in Hours` as the dependent variable 
- Analyzed independent variables representing characteristics of absentees

### 2. Data Cleaning Process
- Identified and rectified errors in the dataset
- Handled missing values to ensure data consistency
- Standardized and organized data for clarity

### 3. Extracting Insights
- Explored categorical variables to provide meaningful interpretations
- Ensured numerical data was properly structured for further analysis

### 4. Preparing for Further Analysis
- The cleaned dataset serves as a foundation for predictive modeling
- Future phases may involve feature engineering and machine learning models

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Why This Project Matters

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data-driven decision-making process. By improving the quality of the dataset, this project contributes to better analysis and predictive capabilities, ultimately benefiting business productivity.
